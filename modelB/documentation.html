<p>This web application visualises wind power production forecasts for wind power plants across Europe.</p>
<h4>Key Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Interactive map with wind power plant information and predictions.</li>
    <li>Customizable input fields to select turbine attributes and display predictions.</li>
    <li>Time in Central European Time (CET/UTC+1), important when contributing data.</li>
    <li>Built using Python, Shiny, and Jupyter notebooks for seamless functionality.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Model Details</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Trained on a dataset of European wind power plants and ECMWF weather data.</li>
    <li>Input features: Turbine Type, Hub Height, Capacity, Age, Wind Speed.</li>
    <li>ML Model: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with four hidden layers and ReLU activation functions.</li>
    <li>Missing Hub Height: Mean value from the database is used as default.</li>
    <li>Missing Commissioning Date: Default set to June 2010 if missing.</li>
    <li>Unknown Turbine Type: Auto-selects 'nan' if the type is not in the database.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Contribution Guidelines</h4>
<p>Please contribute your data to help improve the model. Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure data is provided in kW for production values (see example file).</li>
    <li>Consider the time zone (CET/UTC+1) when submitting data.</li>
    <li>Extreme input values may lead to less accurate predictions due to limited training.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Motivation for Contribution</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Helps improve the wind power forecast (WPF) model.</li>
    <li>Facilitates wind power plant integration into the electricity grid.</li>
    <li>Supports the reduction of dependency on fossil fuels.</li>
    <li>Participation could be a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative for sustainability.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Data Security and Privacy</h4>
<ul>
    <li>All uploads are encrypted (HTTPS).</li>
    <li>Data is stored securely until the next training cycle.</li>
    <li>Data is destroyed after training.</li>
    <li>Your data remain anonymous.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Transparency</h4>
<p>Transparency is provided regarding how crowdsourced data is used to improve the model.</p>
